# üåç Global GitHub Copilot Bootcamp

## üìù GitHub Copilot Labs Guide

Let‚Äôs build something together with GitHub Copilot!  
This lab will help you get hands-on experience using Copilot to solve programming challenges and improve your workflow.

We suggest using [Copilot Adventures](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotAdventures) as inspiration for your projects.

- **If you‚Äôre new:** Start with the **Warmup Adventure**.
- **If you‚Äôre confident:** Explore other adventures from the list above.
- **Tip:** Use any programming language and IDE you like. Most Copilot features are available in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## üó∫Ô∏è Lab Flow

Follow these steps to get the most from your lab experience.  
Example: **Warmup Adventure** ‚Äì Predict the next number in an arithmetic sequence.

---

### 1. Start Simple: Build the Console App

- **Goal:**  
  Generate a console app with Copilot that predicts the next number in a sequence.
- **Tips:**  
  - Pick your preferred language (JavaScript, Python, C#, etc.)
  - Use Copilot Chat to scaffold the code, store a sample array, and print the next number.

---

### 2. Refactor and Organize

- **Goal:**  
  Improve structure and readability.
- **Tips:**  
  - Move core logic into a function.
  - Add comments/docstrings with Copilot.

---

### 3. Add Error Handling

- **Goal:**  
  Make your app robust against invalid input.
- **Tips:**  
  - Ensure there are at least three numbers in the sequence.
  - Check if the sequence is arithmetic; inform the user if not.

---

### 4. Add Tests

- **Goal:**  
  Verify your logic works in various scenarios.
- **Tips:**  
  - Use Copilot to generate and run unit tests.
  - Experiment with unit, integration, and edge case tests.

---

### 5. Add User Input

- **Goal:**  
  Let users enter their own sequence.
- **Tips:**  
  - Prompt for input, parse it, and output the prediction (with Copilot‚Äôs help).

---

### 6. Add a README

- **Goal:**  
  Document your adventure.
- **Tips:**  
  - Use Copilot to generate a README with a description, usage, and examples.

---

### 7. Add a Simple UI

- **Ideas:**  
  - Command-line menu (default or custom sequence).
  - Web page UI (input box, submit button).

---

### 8. Refactor as a Web API

- **Idea:**  
  Turn your logic into a REST API (e.g., Node.js/Express, Flask, FastAPI).

---

### 9. Brainstorm & Implement a New Feature

- **Goal:**  
  Use Copilot to generate ideas and implement something new!

## üß≠ Choosing the Right Copilot Mode

GitHub Copilot has three modes: **Ask**, **Edit**, and **Agent**.  
Here‚Äôs when to use each mode in your lab:

---

### üí¨ Ask Mode

**Best for:**
- Understanding code (‚ÄúExplain the sort function‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is the database connection string defined?‚Äù)
- Getting coding help (‚ÄúHow do I implement the factory pattern?‚Äù)
- Building your knowledge base (‚ÄúWhat are best practices in .NET for Web API?‚Äù)
- Brainstorming ideas (‚ÄúHow can I improve the performance of my application?‚Äù)

**Use Ask Mode to:**
- Clarify unfamiliar code
- Get explanations or summaries
- Ask for best practices
- Brainstorm features or improvements

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Edit Mode

**Best for:**
- Refactoring code
- Fixing specific bugs
- Adding new features
- Writing/updating unit tests
- Optimizing code performance
- Standardizing or documenting code

**Use Edit Mode to:**
- Make targeted code changes
- Refactor, improve, or document your project
- Generate or update tests
- Fix bugs

---

### ü§ñ Agent Mode

**Best for:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Building new API endpoints
- Migrating to a new framework
- Refactoring into a new pattern
- Generating implementation plans
- Debugging with troubleshooting plans

**Use Agent Mode to:**
- Build out larger features or prototypes
- Get Copilot to lead on multi-step tasks
- Plan complex changes
- Scaffold new projects or modules

---

**Tip:**  
Switch between modes as your needs change! For example:
- **Ask** for advice on patterns
- **Edit** your code to apply suggestions
- Use **Agent** to scaffold features or migrate your codebase

---

Happy coding! üöÄ
