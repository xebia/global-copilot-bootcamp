# üåç Global GitHub Copilot Bootcamp

## üìù GitHub Copilot Labs Guide

Let‚Äôs build something together with GitHub Copilot!  
This lab will help you get hands-on experience using Copilot to solve programming challenges and improve your workflow.

We suggest using [Copilot Adventures](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotAdventures) as inspiration for your projects.

- **If you‚Äôre new:** Start with the **Warmup Adventure**.
- **If you‚Äôre confident:** Explore other adventures from the list above.
- **Tip:** Use any programming language and IDE you like. Most Copilot features are available in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Lab Flow

Follow these steps to get the most from your lab experience.  
Example: [Warmup Adventure](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotAdventures/blob/main/Adventures/Warmup-Adventure.md) ‚Äì Predict the next number in an arithmetic sequence.  

---

### 1. Start Simple: Build the Console App

- **Goal:**  
  Generate a console app with Copilot that predicts the next number in a sequence.
- **Tips:**  
  - Pick your preferred language (JavaScript, Python, C#, etc.)
  - Use Copilot Chat to scaffold the code, store a sample array, and print the next number.

---

### 2. Refactor and Organize

- **Goal:**  
  Improve structure and readability.
- **Tips:**  
  - Move core logic into a function.
  - Add comments/docstrings with Copilot.

---

### 3. Add Error Handling

- **Goal:**  
  Make your app robust against invalid input.
- **Tips:**  
  - Ensure there are at least three numbers in the sequence.
  - Check if the sequence is arithmetic; inform the user if not.

---

### 4. Add Tests

- **Goal:**  
  Verify your logic works in various scenarios.
- **Tips:**  
  - Use Copilot to generate and run unit tests.
  - Experiment with unit, integration, and edge case tests.

---

### 5. Add User Input

- **Goal:**  
  Let users enter their own sequence.
- **Tips:**  
  - Prompt for input, parse it, and output the prediction (with Copilot‚Äôs help).

---

### 6. Add a README

- **Goal:**  
  Document your adventure.
- **Tips:**  
  - Use Copilot to generate a README with a description, usage, and examples.

---

### 7. Add a Simple UI

- **Ideas:**  
  - Command-line menu (default or custom sequence).
  - Web page UI (input box, submit button).

---

### 8. Refactor as a Web API

- **Idea:**  
  Turn your logic into a REST API (e.g., Node.js/Express, Flask, FastAPI).

---

### 9. Brainstorm & Implement a New Feature

- **Goal:**  
  Use Copilot to generate ideas and implement something new!

## Version Control Best Practices

We recommend using a Git repository to store your code for all labs and exercises. Commit your changes often with clear messages. This makes it easy to revert to previous versions if needed and encourages good development habits when working with AI tools like GitHub Copilot.

## üß≠ Choosing the Right Copilot Mode

GitHub Copilot has three modes: **Ask**, **Edit**, and **Agent**.  
Here‚Äôs when to use each mode in your lab:

---

### üí¨ Ask Mode

**Best for:**
- Understanding code (‚ÄúExplain the sort function‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is the database connection string defined?‚Äù)
- Getting coding help (‚ÄúHow do I implement the factory pattern?‚Äù)
- Building your knowledge base (‚ÄúWhat are best practices in .NET for Web API?‚Äù)
- Brainstorming ideas (‚ÄúHow can I improve the performance of my application?‚Äù)

**Use Ask Mode to:**
- Clarify unfamiliar code
- Get explanations or summaries
- Ask for best practices
- Brainstorm features or improvements

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Edit Mode

**Best for:**
- Refactoring code
- Fixing specific bugs
- Adding new features
- Writing/updating unit tests
- Optimizing code performance
- Standardizing or documenting code

**Use Edit Mode to:**
- Make targeted code changes
- Refactor, improve, or document your project
- Generate or update tests
- Fix bugs

---

### ü§ñ Agent Mode

**Best for:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Building new API endpoints
- Migrating to a new framework
- Refactoring into a new pattern
- Generating implementation plans
- Debugging with troubleshooting plans

**Use Agent Mode to:**
- Build out larger features or prototypes
- Get Copilot to lead on multi-step tasks
- Plan complex changes
- Scaffold new projects or modules

---

**Tip:**  
Switch between modes as your needs change! For example:
- **Ask** for advice on patterns
- **Edit** your code to apply suggestions
- Use **Agent** to scaffold features or migrate your codebase

---

Happy coding! üöÄ
